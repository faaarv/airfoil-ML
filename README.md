**Predict Airfoil Lift/Drag Coefficient using ML**

## Introduction

This technical report explores the application of machine learning (ML) in aerodynamics, particularly focusing on predicting aerodynamic coefficients. The dataset comprises airfoil geometry data from airfoiltools.com and the corresponding outputs generated by XFOIL software.
In this study, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is employed on the provided dataset to model the relationship between airfoil geometry and aerodynamic performance. The MLP aims to enhance predictive capabilities, allowing for more efficient design optimizations in aerospace applications. The findings suggest that leveraging machine learning techniques can significantly improve the understanding and prediction of aerodynamic behaviors.

## Approach:

**1.Dataset**

The dataset utilized in this project is a comprehensive collection of airfoil data, available through: https://github.com/nasa/airfoil-learning.  Notably, this is an unprocessed dataset, and normalization is applied later during preprocessing. The dataset includes the following key components:

	- Airfoil Geometry : Represented by (x, y) coordinates that define the shape of each airfoil.
	- Flow Conditions : Various parameters that affect airfoil performance:
		○ Reynolds number (Re)
		○ Angle of attack (AoA)
		○ Ncrit (transition criterion parameter)
	- XFOIL Results:
		○ Drag coefficient (Cd)
		○ Pressure drag coefficient (Cdp)
		○ Moment coefficient (Cm)
		○ Lift coefficient (Cl)
		○ Pressure coefficient (Cp) for both upper and lower surfaces

In this dataset, the airfoil geometry is represented by x and y. The x values range from 0 to 1 and are consistent across all airfoils, while the corresponding y values vary for each x. This variation in y defines the unique shape and characteristics of each airfoil.
In this study, the features are represented by y, Re, AoA, Ncrit. The labels correspond to the aerodynamic coefficients generated by XFOIL, lift coefficient (Cl) and drag coefficient (Cd).  By training the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model on this structured data, we aim to establish a predictive relationship between the airfoil geometry features, Flow Conditions and their corresponding aerodynamic performance labels.

**2. Preprocessing and Normalization**

Preprocessing and normalization are essential steps in preparing data for machine learning models, ensuring that the input features are on a comparable scale and enhancing the model's performance.In this study, the raw dataset is normalized during preprocessing using both min-max normalization and standard normalization techniques.
	• Min-max normalization rescales the data to a fixed range, preserving the relationships among the original values and making it easier for the model to learn from the features without being biased by their original scales.
	• Standard normalization (or Z-score normalization) transforms the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This approach ensures that all features contribute equally to model training, particularly when features have different units or distributions.
By applying both techniques, we evaluate their effects on convergence speed and predictive accuracy, identifying the normalization method best suited to our model.

**3. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a class of artificial neural networks that consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons. MLPs are widely used for various machine learning tasks, including regression and classification, due to their ability to model complex nonlinear relationships in data. The architecture typically includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. MLPs are particularly effective for tasks where relationships between input features and outputs are not easily discernible, making them suitable for aerodynamic coefficient prediction.

**4. Model Evaluation**

K-fold cross-validation is employed to assess model performance and generalization capability. In this method, the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained on k−1k-1k−1 folds while the remaining fold serves as the test set. This process is repeated k times, with each fold being used as a test set exactly once.
	• In this study, k is set to 10, balancing computational efficiency with thorough evaluation.
	• K-fold cross-validation mitigates overfitting and provides a reliable estimate of model performance across subsets.

**5. Hyperparameter Tuning**

Various model configurations are explored, including:

	• Adjustments to the number of hidden layers
	• Number of units per layer
	• Learning rate
	• Number of epochs
	• Batch size
The evaluation metrics include:

	• Mean squared error (MSE)
	• Standard deviation of the MSE
	• Training time
	• R-squared (R²)
These metrics are used to analyze accuracy, stability, and efficiency. By exploring these configurations, we aim to identify the optimal setup for predictive performance while maintaining computational efficiency.
